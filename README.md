## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently focusing on `dotnet` and `go` and using it to build out automation or applications.

I am spending my time building out my dream project `Newsbot`.  Take a look at it if you want to learn more.

- Newsbot = Passion project to improve the personalized news feed. 
- [dvb](https://github.com/jtom38/dvb) = Go tool to backup docker images.  Used in my homelab.
